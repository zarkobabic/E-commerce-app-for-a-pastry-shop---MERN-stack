# E-commerce app for pastry shop - MERN Stack

**Project Overview:**
This project is an e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The platform integrates Redux.js to efficiently manage cart items across a single-page application. It also employs a REST API to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend. The platform supports two distinct user roles: shoppers and workers.

**Technology Stack:**
- **MongoDB:** Non-relational database to store data.
- **Express.js:** Backend web application framework to handle API routes and server-side logic.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for executing backend code.
- **Redux.js:** Library for managing application state, particularly for cart item management.
