# E-commerce app for pastry shop - MERN Stack


**Project Overview:**
This project is an e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The platform integrates Redux.js to efficiently manage cart items across a single-page application. It also employs a REST API to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend. The platform supports two distinct user roles: shoppers and workers.

### **Technology Stack:**
- **MongoDB:** Non-relational database to store data.
- **Express.js:** Backend web application framework to handle API routes and server-side logic.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for executing backend code.
- **Redux.js:** Library for managing application state, particularly for cart item management.

### **User Roles:**

1. **Shopper:**
   - View items available for sale.
   - Manage profile information.
   - Shop items.

   - Receive notifications when a worker accepts or rejects an order.

2. **Worker:**
   - Manage requests for orders.
   - Add new products to the platform.

### **Functionalities:**

- **Shopper:**

  - **Product Management:** Workers can add new products to the platform, ensuring the inventory is up-to-date.

### **REST API:**
The platform uses a RESTful API to enable communication between the frontend and backend, handling operations such as retrieving items, managing user profiles, processing orders, and managing comments and notifications.

### **Conclusion:**
This MERN stack project provides a robust and scalable e-commerce platform, catering to the needs of both shoppers and workers. By leveraging modern technologies and a well-structured API, it ensures a seamless shopping experience and efficient order management.
